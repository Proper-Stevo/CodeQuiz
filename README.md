# CodeQuiz

## Description

This was a great test for me because I was struggling with JavaScript. And it pushed my knowledge to the breaking point. Althought I know most of the steps its the figuring out how they go together that really makes you a great developer. 


## Installation
## Usage

I think this quiz is great for the use of a refresher for everyone to use here and there, its not a full cohort or anything but its nice to remember some things.
